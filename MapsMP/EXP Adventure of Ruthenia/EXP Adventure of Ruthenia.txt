Adventure of Ruthenia||1v1, UltraFastStart||Ruthenia lived her life in peace, but a cracking volcano (called Granite the Stable) broke this life into tiny pieces. Now Ruthenia opened up her eyes and decided to search for the broken pieces. Picked up her packs and bags and went to a journey behind the unknown, behind the bridge where all the roads ends. Will her find a new home or suddenly will find something mirrored?||Location made by [$11DD11]Ben[] for the MegaLand project.|Have Fun!|Made by [$80BF00]MaPhisto[]

0:Our spies report that the enemy is mobilizing. He is poorly armed, but he uses gold from the mountains, thanks to which he can quickly buy an army.
1:There is not too much gold in these areas, it is better to buy it. We have two rings that we can exchange for something much needed. You just need to spend them wisely.
2:The enemy intends to take revenge for the village we destroyed for him. As they say, an eye for an eye, a building for a building.
3:Our current barbarians are bought from merchants from a distant, frosty land. They are used to enduring difficult conditions. Let's not waste their abilities.

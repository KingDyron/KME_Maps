0:Basics
1:Before you attack the enemies to the west, you must first deal with the scouts hiding nearby to the north. By left-clicking on your lance-carriers group and right-clicking on the enemy troops, you should encourage your troops to make a daring attack.
2:A company of bowmen lieth to the south-west. Attack it with thy militia. But caution to order the charge at the proper moment, lest enemy arrows inflict terrible losses on thy stalwart troops!
3:Attack the enemy forces which lie in waiting to the west. Watch for enemy bowmen for they have entrenched themselves behind the infantry! Send thy scouts to the north that they may encircle the enemy and attack from the rear.
4:Now thou shalt launch an attack with all thy forces at once. Place thy bowmen behind thine infantry to drive back the enemy lines. If thou art glorious, the battle tutorial is complete.
5:Congratulations! You have learned the basic principles of fighting the enemy.
6:For completing the tutorial, you get a secret code "/ks.drein_leadership" that you can enter in the console during a solo game. However, remember, every code is a cheat.

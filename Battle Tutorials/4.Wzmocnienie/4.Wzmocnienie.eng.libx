0:Reinforcements
1:Your iron units may be stronger than you think. In the Keep during recruitment, you can arm your iron soldiers with Bitin chainmail, if you have it.
2:You can produce such an item in the Armor Smithy. Set the production to 8 pieces. This amount is enough to equip your units.
3:Now that you have the required amount of chainmail in your Keep, you only need one more. Train 8 recruits who will equip the powerful weapons. Once you have enough recruits, equip 8 Sword Footmen.
4:There are two groups of Warriors stationed in the south. Without Bitin Armor, you would have lost for sure. However, now you can wipe them out without major unit losses.
5:Congratulations! Reinforced units will help you with stronger units.
6:For completing the tutorial, you get a secret code "/ks.armor_of_truth" that you can enter in the console during a solo game. However, remember, every code is a cheat.

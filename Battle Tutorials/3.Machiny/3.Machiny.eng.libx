0:Siege Machines
1:Sometimes the enemy is able to defend their city with walls. Among the units you can have are siege machines. Each machine has its own unique properties.
2:Ballistas are perfect against units. Catapults are excellent at destroying structures from a distance. Battering Rams are devastating to structures, but are slow. Mobile Walls will distract and hold the enemy for a long time.
3:There is only one natural passage in the north. However, it is protected by a powerful defensive wall. To destroy it, you can move in two ways. Use Battering Rams, but then the enemy units will be alerted. Therefore, the best idea is to use Catapults.
4:Now deploy your Moving Walls and place Ballistas behind them. When you're ready, use the Catapult to bring in enemy units.
5:The city is still protected by powerful Defense Towers. Send Battering Rams towards them. These machines are very durable and if not stopped within the range of the tower, they will survive the route to the building.
6:Now raze the rest of the city to the ground.
7:Congratulations! Now you know how to show your position in society.
8:For completing the tutorial, you get a secret code "/ks.artidram_forge" that you can enter in the console during a solo game. However, remember, every code is a cheat.

1:In the far east, there is a small village of peasants who grow pomegranate trees. Let's build an emissary's house and a shipyard. Thanks to that, we will be able to transfer goods to them and they will be able to expand their village.
2:So many islands and resources on them, deserve to be collected. Let's connect them with bridges or use boats to be able to get rare materials.
3:The newcomers from the west have sent us miners and a metallurgist. They want us to develop and help fight the threat from the north.

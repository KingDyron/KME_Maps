0:On the eastern part of the island, there is a village of builders. They mainly deal with building machines. They will help us in the fight against the enemy.
1:We don't have much land to build on, especially since there's a merchant village nearby. They're using the Town Hall to defend themselves against their enemies. With the help of our ally's lecter, let's try to take over as many buildings as possible.
2:As it turns out, the locals don't like the Sowers either. Not everyone will side with us, so stay alert for incoming attacks.
3:The new arrivals from the north want our lands for their own. We can't let that happen. There are also arrivals from the south, but they want to fight the Sowers. In that case, the enemy of our enemy is our friend.
4:My cousin has decided to fight for his territory alone. He doesn't want any alliances, and his hatred for us makes him our enemy as well.
5:Let's use our skills in creating machines. Mobile Walls will perfectly stop the enemy soldiers and Catapults will crush them.

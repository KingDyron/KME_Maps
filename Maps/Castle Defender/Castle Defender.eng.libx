0:Castle Defender
1:Quickly! We must help our King in battle!
2:The Kingdom cannot be defenseless. We must rebuild walls as fast as possible. Otherwise the enemy will take over our territories.
3:The enemy will not be merciful after our victory. Expect another massive attack soon.
4:Cursed are those who attacked us! They have devastated vast areas in the north, and now they want to come for us. Winter makes it difficult for us to act, but that does not mean we will not defend ourselves.
